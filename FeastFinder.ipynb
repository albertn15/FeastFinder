        "Di era digital saat ini, volume informasi yang tersedia sangat banyak dan seringkali bisa sangat membingungkan, sehingga membuat pengguna kesulitan untuk menemukan rekomendasi yang relevan dan personal. Hal ini terutama berlaku dalam domain rekomendasi restoran, di mana pengguna mencari saran yang sesuai dengan selera dan preferensi mereka. Untuk mengatasi kebutuhan ini, kita dapat mengembangkan sistem rekomendasi restoran yang memanfaatkan cosine similarity, sebuah teknik populer dalam pencarian informasi dan penambangan teks."

        "    - Pembuatan Rekomendasi: Berdasarkan skor cosine similarity, kami akan menghasilkan rekomendasi untuk pengguna. Restoran dengan skor kesamaan yang lebih tinggi terhadap preferensi pengguna akan diberi peringkat lebih tinggi dalam daftar rekomendasi.\n",

        "- Dari plot tersebut, kita dapat melihat bahwa tipe restoran yang paling diminati adalah `american` dan `italian`. Ini dikarenakan beberapa alasan:\n",
        "    -  Sejumlah besar imigran Italia telah masuk ke Amerika sepanjang abad ke-19 dan ke-20. Oleh karena itu, masuk akal jika budaya kuliner mereka telah diserap dan diadopsi oleh orang Amerika selama bertahun-tahun.\n",
        "    - Masakan Italia dikaitkan dengan gaya hidup sehat karena menggunakan protein tanpa lemak, sayuran, minyak zaitun, dan berbagai bahan lainnya yang berfokus pada kesehatan. Ini sejalan dengan tren makan sehat saat ini di Amerika Serikat, khususnya di pesisir barat seperti di negara bagian California dan Portland.\n",
        "    - Pasta dan pizza telah menjadi makanan pokok di seluruh negeri. Berbagai daerah bahkan memiliki spesialisasi mereka sendiri seperti deep dish Chicago atau thin crust New York."
